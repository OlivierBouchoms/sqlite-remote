# sqlite-remote

Remotely access your SQLite database

## Context

SQLite databases can be used for various purposes, including providing an alternative for a database server (such as MySQL). However, SQLite is not designed to be accessed remotely.

This project aims to solve this problem, without introducing risks of data corruption or other problems that might occur when SQLite databases are accessed over the network.
